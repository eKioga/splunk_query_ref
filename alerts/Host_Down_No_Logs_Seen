```This alert checks the time stamps on the logs sent to splunk```
```If the latest log sent from a host is greater than 5 minutes, it will throw an alert.```
```This helps determine if a host is offline or if a splunk agent needs to be reset.```
```If you need to take a host down, you might need to add "host!=ServerName01" to the line below until 24 hours has passed.```
